# Jesus.js

Not sure what will it do yet. But it just sounds like a really powerful library no matter what it does.

## API
	//The global variable Jesus will be removed and be back in 3 days.
	Jesus.die();

	//Makes all elements become float left or right.(Not working lower than IE8)
	Jesus.walkOnWater();
